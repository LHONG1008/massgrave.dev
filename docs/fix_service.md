# Fix Windows Services

## Corrupt service - sppsvc

- Follow the steps below only if the script shows that `sppsvc` **service** is corrupt. Do not follow otherwise.
- Download and extract the `sppsvc` registry zip file for [Windows 10](https://app.box.com/s/016qsq922nt3kgg744l07y115k9wph4b) / [Windows 11](https://app.box.com/s/zq70tlbuo3iwxjd76ly26sz0gs2b98n0)
- Be careful, run these files only if they are matching with your Windows version, if not then ask for help [here](troubleshoot.md).
- Run the file, restart the system (using the restart button), and try the activation script again.
- If the issue persists, contact us [here](troubleshoot.md).

## Corrupt service - Null

- Follow these steps only if the script crashes after that.
- Download and extract this Null service registry zip [file](https://app.box.com/s/eczou3mvn6atronnd3nad2sqtb66h0lw).
- Run the file, restart the system (using the restart button), and try the activation script again.
- If the issue persists, check if you are using `Comodo Antivirus` or any type of `sandboxing` security software. If so, temporarily disable it and run the script again.
