## Help Fight Malware & Fake Content  

If you search for ways to activate Windows or Office for free on Google or YouTube, you may come across malware disguised as real activators.  
While removing such content from websites is challenging, taking down fraudulent YouTube videos is easierâ€”all it takes is enough reports against them.  

Please check [this list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/WindowsAddict/a2eb95d2a88e403fa4dda2f0bbac9065/raw) and report these videos and channels to help make the internet a safer place.

We will update this list as needed in the future.
