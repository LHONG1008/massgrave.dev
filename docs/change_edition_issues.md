-   During a Home to Pro upgrade, the script may show the below error:  
```         
Exception calling "_DismSet Edition" with "6" argument(s): "Element not found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070490)"
```
-   This issue often appears when .NET Framework 3.5 is installed.
-   To solve this, it needs to be disabled. To do that, open Command Prompt as admin and enter  
    `DISM /Online /English /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:"NetFx3"`
-   Once that's done, try to change the edition again.
-   After the edition change, you can enable .NET 3.5 again:  
    `DISM /Online /English /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:"NetFx3"`
